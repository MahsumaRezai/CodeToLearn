                     Coding is also known as programming â€“ even though a lot of people would argue there is a slight difference
                      between the two,coding and programming still reference the same general process in the long run.
                      People who code are known as programmers or developers, and the set of instructions they pass on to a computer
                      is called a program.</p>
